Thanks for using total.js - web application framework for node.js

To activate Total.js - View Engine, set the syntax using the Goto Anything or the View -> Syntax menu.
To set Html Extended syntax to always open html (or others) files, follow these steps:
open an html file that has a web component in it
from the menu, select: View -> Syntax -> Open all with current extension as... -> Total.js - View Engine
